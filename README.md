# CircleImageRecyclerViewwithIntent
This app, similar to the "Toast" one, uses some dependencies, including "recyclerview" and "glide", and "circleimageview". As you might expect, this has a RecyclerView layout. It contains images that are retrieved from the internet. Images are turned into circles, and each image has a name (that I gave it). When the image is clicked on, the user is taken to a new activity.  Tapping on any listing will take you to "GalleryActivity", but that activity will populate with whichever image and name the listing has.  This is due to the passing in of "putExtra" information that depends on the listing that was clicked on.
